The advantages in the use of computers are immense. In a very short time a computer can do thousands of calculations. It works fast and also neatly and efficiently. It can at ease store a lot of information in its memory for future use. Even the scientific problems of complex nature can be solved in a few seconds with its help. It helps us to pay telephone and electricity bills, to book railway reservation. Its use has sped our works. With all its merits, the computer is not without its demerits.

As the figure shows, we have five communicating devices in this communication: the source host (computer A), the link-layer switch in link 1, the router, the link-layer switch in link 2, and the destination host (computer B). Each device is involved with a set of layers depending on the role of the device in the internet. The two hosts are involved in all five layers; the source host needs to create a message in the application layer and send it down the layers so that it is physically sent to the destination host.

In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space Science has brought a great many wonderful things for us. The latest kind is the computer. The computer, as we find it to-day, is an electronic machine. It was invented in 1834 by an English mathematician named Charles Babbage.

Disadvantages of Mesh Topology ●Installation and configuration are difficult. ●The cost of maintenance is high. Star Topology In Star Topology, all the devices are connected to a single hub through a cable. This hub is the central node and all other nodes are connected to the central node. Unlike a mesh topology, a star topology does not allow direct traffic between devices.)=>{'title': 'Data Communicaiton CT', 'page': 3}\n\n        Question:\n        what is the fastest computing device\n"
